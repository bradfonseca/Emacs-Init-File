* Emacs-Init-File

** General Information

My first repository to learn about git, github and using it with emacs.

My init.el file's starting point came from here:
http://www1.cmc.edu/pages/faculty/alee/emacs/emacs.html 

As much as possible I have tried to indicate clearly what changes I
have made (and during the use of what version of Emacs), as opposed
those already existing in the file I used, with a comment as follows:

#+NAME: Example comment block from init.el file
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; FBF: added with v. 24.3.1
;; <some edifying comment here>
<elisp code here>
#+END_SRC

I like :coffee:, :pizza:, Emacs, and wombats.
